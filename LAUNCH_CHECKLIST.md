üó∫Ô∏è **Excited to launch BA Pathfinder!**

I noticed a gap in the BA community - we have no visual, interactive career roadmaps like developers have with roadmap.sh.

So I built one: https://github.com/guitargnarr/ba-pathfinder

üéØ **What it includes:**
‚úÖ Junior BA ‚Üí Senior BA ‚Üí Director pathways
‚úÖ Product Owner, BSA, Data Analyst specializations
‚úÖ Certification prep (CBAP, CCBA, PMI-PBA)
‚úÖ Tool mastery paths (Jira, SQL, Power BI)

üìñ **Open source, free forever, community-driven.**

Looking for experienced BAs to help validate the roadmaps!

Title: I built an open-source BA career roadmap (like roadmap.sh for developers)

Hey r/businessanalysis!

I'm a BA with 9 years of experience, and I noticed we don't have visual,
interactive career roadmaps like developers have. So I built one.

BA Pathfinder: https://github.com/guitargnarr/ba-pathfinder

Features:
- Junior ‚Üí Mid ‚Üí Senior BA progression
- Product Owner, BSA, Data Analyst paths
- Certification guides (CBAP, CCBA, PMI-PBA)
- Tool mastery roadmaps

100% free, open source, community-driven.

Looking for feedback from experienced BAs! What am I missing?
