## 🎯 What's Next: Sharing & Marketing

Now that the site is live, you can share it with the BA community!

### 1. LinkedIn Post (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
🗺️ Excited to launch BA Pathfinder - now LIVE!

After seeing a gap in our community (developers have roadmap.sh, but BAs don't), I built an interactive career roadmap platform for Business Analysts.

🚀 Live site: https://ba-pathfinder.vercel.app
📦 Open source: https://github.com/guitargnarr/ba-pathfinder

What's included:
✅ Junior → Senior → Director career paths
✅ Product Owner, BSA, Data Analyst specializations
✅ Certification guides (CBAP, CCBA, PMI-PBA)
✅ Tool mastery roadmaps (Jira, SQL, Power BI)

100% free, community-driven, open source.

Looking for experienced BAs to help validate the roadmaps! Check out Issue #1 for how to contribute.

**Best time to post:**
- Weekdays: 9am-11am or 1pm-3pm
- Tuesday-Thursday (highest engagement)

### 2. Reddit Communities

**r/businessanalysis** - Main target audience
```
Title: I built a free, open-source BA career roadmap (now live!)

I'm a BA with 9 years of experience. I noticed we don't have visual,
interactive career roadmaps like developers have with roadmap.sh.

So I built one: https://ba-pathfinder.vercel.app
GitHub: https://github.com/guitargnarr/ba-pathfinder

Features:
- Junior → Mid → Senior BA progression
- Product Owner, BSA, Data Analyst specializations
- Certification prep guides (CBAP, CCBA, PMI-PBA)
- Tool mastery paths

Free, open source, community-driven. Looking for feedback from
experienced BAs - what am I missing? See Issue #1!
```

- r/analytics
- r/datascience (for Data Analyst roadmap)
- r/agile (for Product Owner roadmap)

Hi everyone! I've just launched BA Pathfinder - a free, open-source
visual career roadmap for Business Analysts.

Live site: https://ba-pathfinder.vercel.app

It's inspired by roadmap.sh (for developers) but tailored to BA career
paths. I'd love feedback from this community on the Junior BA roadmap
(Issue #1 on GitHub).

Completely free, no ads, no paywalls. Just trying to help aspiring BAs
navigate their careers!
