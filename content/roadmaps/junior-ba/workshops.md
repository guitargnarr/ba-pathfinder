## Types of Requirement Workshops

### 1. JAD (Joint Application Development)
**Purpose:** Define requirements collaboratively with business and technical stakeholders

**When to Use:**
- Complex systems with multiple stakeholder groups
- Need consensus on requirements before development
- Waterfall projects

**Example:**
Building a new CRM system ‚Üí JAD workshop with Sales, Marketing, IT, and Customer Service

---

### 2. Design Thinking Workshop
**Purpose:** Ideation and rapid prototyping

**Phases:**
1. **Empathize:** Understand user needs
2. **Define:** Frame the problem
3. **Ideate:** Brainstorm solutions (diverge)
4. **Prototype:** Build quick mockups
5. **Test:** Get feedback

**When to Use:**
- Innovative/new products
- User-centered design needed
- Uncertainty about solution

---

### 3. Story Mapping Workshop
**Purpose:** Visualize product backlog and prioritize features

**Output:** User story map (visual backlog)

**When to Use:**

---

## Planning a Workshop (2-3 Weeks Before)

### Step 1: Define Clear Objectives
‚ùå **Bad:** "Discuss the new feature"
‚úÖ **Good:** "By end of workshop, we will have:
  - Prioritized list of 20 user stories
  - Agreement on MVP scope
  - Identified risks and dependencies"

---

### Step 2: Invite the Right People (6-12 participants)
**Too Few (<6):** Not enough diverse perspectives
**Too Many (>12):** Hard to facilitate, people disengage

**Who to Invite:**
- Decision-makers (1-2)
- Subject matter experts (3-4)
- End users (2-3)
- Technical team (1-2)
- BA (facilitator)

**Example:** E-Commerce Checkout Workshop
- Product Owner (decision-maker)
- 2 UX designers
- 2 developers
- 2 customer service reps (user perspective)
- BA (you)

---

### Step 3: Schedule 2-4 Hour Block
**Recommended Times:**
- ‚úÖ Tuesday-Thursday, 9am-12pm or 1pm-4pm
- ‚ùå Avoid: Mondays (people catching up), Fridays (people check out), after 3pm

**Send Calendar Invite with:**
- Clear agenda (detailed in next step)

## Facilitating the Workshop

### Opening (10 minutes)

**1. Welcome & Introductions**
"Thanks everyone for being here. Let's do quick intros‚Äîname, role, what you hope to get from today."

**2. Set Ground Rules**
- One conversation at a time
- All ideas are valid (no criticism during brainstorming)
- Respect the clock
- Phones on silent
- "Yes, and..." instead of "No, but..."

**3. State Objectives**
"By end of this workshop, we'll have a prioritized list of 20 features and agreement on what's in our MVP."

**4. Introduce Parking Lot**
"If we go off-topic, I'll capture it in the parking lot and we'll address it later."

---

### Brainstorming Phase (Diverge - Generate Ideas)

**Rules:**
1. **Quantity over quality** - Generate as many ideas as possible
2. **No criticism** - All ideas welcome
3. **Build on others** - "Yes, and..."
4. **Wild ideas encouraged** - Often lead to innovation

**Techniques:**

#### Silent Brainstorming (5-10 min)
Everyone writes ideas on sticky notes silently
- Prevents groupthink
- Ensures introverts contribute
- Generates diverse ideas

#### Round-Robin Sharing (15-20 min)
Each person shares one idea at a time
- Everyone gets equal airtime
- No one dominates

#### Affinity Grouping (15-20 min)
Group similar sticky notes into themes
- "These 5 ideas all relate to payment options"
- Creates structure from chaos

---

### Prioritization Phase (Converge - Narrow Down)

**Technique 1: MoSCoW Prioritization**
- **M**ust have (non-negotiable)
- **S**hould have (important but not critical)
- **C**ould have (nice to have)
- **W**on't have this time (deferred)

**Example:**
```
Must Have:
- Login functionality
- Product search
- Shopping cart

Should Have:
- Wish list
- Product reviews
- Related products

Could Have:
- Social sharing
- 3D product viewer

Won't Have (v1):
- AR try-on
- Voice search
```

---

**Technique 2: Dot Voting**
Each participant gets 5 dots
- Place dots on features you think are most important
- Can put multiple dots on same feature
- Tally results ‚Üí prioritized list

---

**Technique 3: Value vs Effort Matrix**

```
     High Value  ‚îÇ  High Value
     Low Effort  ‚îÇ  High Effort
                 ‚îÇ
     ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îº‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
     Low Value   ‚îÇ  Low Value
     Low Effort  ‚îÇ  High Effort
```

**Prioritize:** High Value + Low Effort (quick wins)

---

### Handling Difficult Situations

#### Problem #1: One Person Dominates
**Solution:** "Thanks John‚Äîlet's hear from others. Sarah, what do you think?"

---

#### Problem #2: Side Conversations
**Solution:** "I'm hearing two conversations‚Äîcan we focus on one topic?"

---

#### Problem #3: Going Off-Topic
**Solution:** "Great point‚ÄîI'm adding that to the parking lot. Let's stay focused on [current topic]."

---

#### Problem #4: Conflict Between Stakeholders
**Solution:**
1. Acknowledge both perspectives: "I hear Marketing wants X, and Sales wants Y"
2. Reframe as shared goal: "We all want to increase revenue..."
3. Explore compromise: "Is there a solution that addresses both needs?"

---

#### Problem #5: Silent Participants
**Solution:**
- Direct question: "Emma, you've been quiet‚Äîwhat's your take on this?"
- Round-robin: Forces everyone to contribute
- Silent brainstorming: Introverts thrive in writing

---

## Virtual Workshop Best Practices

### Tools
- **Video:** Zoom (breakout rooms for small group activities)
- **Whiteboarding:** Miro, Mural (collaborative sticky notes)
- **Polling:** Slido, Mentimeter (real-time voting)
- **Documentation:** Google Docs (shared note-taking)

### Tips
1. **Cameras ON** - Builds engagement
2. **Mute when not speaking** - Reduces background noise
3. **Use chat** - For questions without interrupting
4. **Breakout rooms** - For small group discussions (3-4 people)
5. **Frequent breaks** - Every 60-90 minutes

### Virtual Engagement Techniques
- **Polls:** "Vote on your top priority: A, B, or C?"
- **Chat storms:** "Everyone type your answer in chat‚Äîgo!"
- **Reactions:** Use emoji reactions for quick feedback
- **Shared doc:** Everyone types simultaneously

---

## Workshop Deliverables & Follow-Up

### Immediate (During Workshop)
- Photograph whiteboards
- Export Miro board as PDF
- Capture decisions in shared doc

### Within 24 Hours (After Workshop)
