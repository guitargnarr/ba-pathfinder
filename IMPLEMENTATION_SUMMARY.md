## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

Before deploying to production:

1. **Test all routes**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # Visit each page manually:
   # - /
   # - /roadmaps/junior-ba
   # - /roadmaps/junior-ba/what-is-ba
   # - etc.
   ```

2. **Build test**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm start
   # Verify production build works
   ```

3. **Check 8 topic pages**:
   - Markdown renders correctly
   - Links work
   - Resources display properly
   - Navigation functions

4. **Mobile testing**:
   - Responsive layouts
   - Touch targets adequate size
   - No horizontal scroll

---

## 📦 Deployment Instructions

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# 2. Build for production
npm run build

# 3. Test locally
npm start

# 4. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement full Junior BA roadmap with topic pages and navigation"

# 5. Push to trigger Vercel auto-deploy
git push -u origin claude/code-base-analysis-011CUUXjMpN9YiGWPpdy6mDp
```

Vercel will automatically:
- Detect the changes
- Run build
- Deploy to production
- Update https://ba-pathfinder.vercel.app

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### Why text-based roadmap instead of D3.js visualization?
- **Speed**: Get MVP live faster
- **Accessibility**: Text is more accessible than complex SVG
- **Mobile**: Text-based works better on small screens
- **Progressive**: Can add D3.js visualization later

### Why inline styles instead of Tailwind CSS?
- **Simplicity**: No build config needed
- **Minimal**: Project is small enough
- **Performance**: No unused CSS
- **Future**: Easy to migrate to Tailwind later

### Why marked.js instead of MDX?
- **Simpler**: Less configuration
- **Faster**: Lighter dependency
- **Sufficient**: Current content doesn't need React components in markdown
- **Future**: Can migrate to MDX if needed
